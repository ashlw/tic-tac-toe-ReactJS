# tic-tac-toe-ReactJS
Created with CodeSandbox
Finished tutorial from https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe and completed additional tasks -
- For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
- Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
